is loose coupling more important than enforcement of interface?

Statements/Expressions/Operators
	An anonymous function is an 'inline' statement or expression that can be used wherever
	a delegate type is expected. You can use it to initialise a named delegate or pass
	it instead of a named delegate type as a method parameter.
	
Methods
	In a method, parameters are types and names given in the definition of the method 
	signature.
	Arguments are the values passed into the method once it is invoked. 
	Value types are passed by value in arguments.
	Reference types pass a reference to the object in arguments. e.g The location of the
	object.

	If a method returns void or is an async method, then the body of the method must be a 
	statement expression. A statement expression is a statement which includes a expression
	and stores the calculated value in a variable. 


Strings
	Use @ for literals
	Use stringbuilder if a string is likely to change. Use string for constant strings.

	return by reference
