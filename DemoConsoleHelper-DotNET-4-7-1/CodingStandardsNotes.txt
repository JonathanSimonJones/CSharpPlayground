Naming Conventions
	One statement per line
	One declaration per line
	Coninuation lines indented one tab (four spaces)
	Add at least one line between method definitions and property definitions
	Use parentheses to make clauses clearer

Commenting Conventions
	Place comment on seperate line
	Begin comment with uppercase letter.
	End comment with period
	Have one space with comment delimiter and comment text
	Do not use formatted blocks of asterisks around comments

Language Guidelines
	String
		Use string interpolation to concat short strings
			string str = $"{arr[0].toString()}, {arr2[1].val}";

		To append strings in loops use stringbuilder object
			var strBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	
	Implicitly typed local vars
		Use implicit when type is obvious
			var foo = "I am a string";
			var clearlyInt = Convert.ToInt32("3");

		Do not use var when type is not apparent, be explicit
		Do not rely on var name to specify type (maybe don't add it to name in first place?)
		Prefer use of dynamic
